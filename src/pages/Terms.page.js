                We are Ryva, Inc. (“Ryva,” “Us,” “We,” or “Our”), and we are a
                platform that is focused on people or goods on the move by
                creating and connecting a global community of friends and
                colleagues who not only want to celebrate shared interests, but
                who also want to minimize cultural, geographic and social
                divisions between them through online and offline communications
                and interactions thereby democratizing logistics through
                technology. Our friends and our community are bound together by
                many things, including a desire to share items, goods, products
                or services between those who may seek to obtain them globally
                and those willing to help bring them to their friends, whom we
                call. We do this through our website, located at
                https://myryva.com, and through our portal and applications,
                which is available through various mobile and computing devices,
                and through our products, services and information, all of which
                we collectively refer to as the “Ryva Platform.”

                relationships between them or the subject matter of such
                relationships. You acknowledge and agree that, except where
                these Terms provide otherwise, it is the Members themselves who
                establish any applicable Traveler Fees. While Ryva may help

                reference to a Member being “Verified” (or similar language)
                only indicates that the Member has completed a verification or

                  Transactions Between interested parties on the Ryva platform
                </h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The Ryva team strives to make the Ryva Platform useful, simple
                  and efficient. Ryva members may gain access to people within
                  the platform who have carriage space locally or
                  internationally to convey items willingly to their Ryva
                  friends and colleagues. At the same time, Ryva enables
                  Travelers to help their friends and community, and may even
                  help them defray the time and expense of their travel to see
                  and help their global Ryva friends. Through the Ryva Platform,
                  Ryva helps to bring diverse groups of people together, and
                  hopefully, to minimize the differences and divisions that can
                  accumulate over time, geographical distance and cultures. As
                  set forth more fully below, in a typical transaction
                  facilitated on the Ryva Platform, the interested party
                  publishes an invitation called a “Request” which identifies a
                  desired Item(s). Interested Travelers or Travelers matched by
                  the Ryva Platform, may then make offers to bring Items on
                  terms expressed between members or both customers. When agreed
                  upon, execution of the “interested party’s Acceptance, fixes
                  the final and binding agreement between the Members.

                Ryva Shoppers expressly agree not to use the Ryva Platform or to
                request that a Traveler obtain or bring any item that is
                prohibited under any international laws or laws of any local
                jurisdiction applicable to Members, goods, transit or
                destination. It is the responsibility of both interested parties
                (and not Ryva) to refrain from requesting or bringing any Item
                that is prohibited either by the jurisdiction of disembarkation,
                transit or embarkation. Prohibited items include, but are not

                Ryva recommends that interested parties consult their respective
                government agencies which regulate items that may and may not be
                brought into or out of a country of origin.

              <h3>Suggested Traveler Fees</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                When the Sender creates a Request, the Ryva Platform may
                auto-calculate a transaction fee for illustrative purposes in
                planning the Senders transaction. As explained below in the
                section “Fees,” the actual Traveler Fee on any given transaction
                is set using the weight and counted per kilogram and may be more
                than, or less than the suggested Fee but must be agreed by both
                parties.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>The Travelers Offer </h3>
              <p>
                To assist Members to locate and communicate with each other,
                including potentially dates upon which Members can meet in
                person, The Ryva Platform allows a sender or travelers to enter
                the details of upcoming travel dates, and to browse published
                Senders Requests made by their Ryva friends. Travelers can
                indicate their preference to be notified of upcoming Senders
                Requests that may correspond to their planned trips, or trips
                that they may be willing to take.

              <p>
                The following components that make up the Total Fees must be
                contained in, and fully described in the Traveler’s Offer. When
                Accepted, the Traveler’s Offer establishes the final and total
                amounts to which the Shopper agrees.{" "}

                <li>
                  Item Cost: A Sender is advised to specify the actual or
                  approximate price value of their item . The Item Cost shall be
                  the amount specified in the Offer;{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Service Fee: This is as service fee charged by and retained by
                  Ryva for the use of its Ryva Platform by Senders and
                  Travelers. Service Fees are collected by Ryva from Senders and
                  deducted from remaining amounts remitted to Travelers by Ryva
                  as the Traveler’s limited payment collection agent as
                  described above. Service Fees are non-refundable.{" "}

                <li>
                  Traveler’s Fee: The Traveler’s Fee is the amount Sender agree
                  to give to their Traveler friends for helping the Sender. As
                  set forth above, Ryva may estimate a Traveler’s Fee for
                  planning purposes, but the actual Traveler’s Fee is set by the
                  Traveler in the Offer. The Service Fee and Traveler’s Fee may
                  collectively be referred to by Ryva as the “Platform Fees).”{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Applicable Taxes: Ryva may auto-calculate an estimate of sales
                  and other taxes associated with the Traveler’s Offer. Ryva
                  always separately states the Applicable Taxes from the Item
                  Cost, and the Platform Fees.

                It is the sole responsibility of the Travelers to be familiar
                with, to specify, and to include in the Traveler’s Offer, any
                and all applicable customs duties, tariffs, and charges

              <h3>Ownership, Acceptance, Risk of Loss and Insurance</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Members acknowledge and agree that except where prohibited by
                applicable law or otherwise agreed to by Members, it is the
                Travelers, and not Senders, who own Items and must maintain for
                presentment all original receipts evidencing such ownership.
                Members also acknowledge and agree that to the maximum extent
                allowed by law, the risk of loss remains with the Traveler
                unless and until the Traveler has completed all of the
                obligations under his or her agreement with the Sender, which
                includes bringing the items as agreed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ryva recommends that Shoppers and Travelers procure their own
                insurance to cover the cost and expenses relating to an item.
                Ryva may but is not obligated to recommend or to offer links
                where members may procure insurance relating to their items.
                Acceptance of Items{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Both parties must agree at the time a request is accepted on a
                specific time period for acceptance of the items. Travelers
                shall bear the responsibility to identify an acceptable safe and
                public place to meet with their senders for the purpose of
                inspection and exchange of goods. The time for delivery can be
                extended only by written agreement between both parties on the
                Ryva Platform, or by Ryva. Unless the parties otherwise agree in
                writing, both have an obligation to inspect and accept the items
                at the time of delivery, and the agreement between the parties
                is deemed complete at the time of acceptance. Unless the parties
                have agreed otherwise in writing, if the goods are not made
                available for delivery and acceptance within five (5) days of
                the delivery date, and with no inspection or acceptance of the
                Item(s), the defaulters Payment Method will be charged and the
                amounts released to the other party. The only permissible method
                to extend the delivery, inspection and acceptance periods agreed
                to by both parties is written communication between the parties
                on the Ryva Platform or through notification by Ryva through the
                Ryva Platform.
